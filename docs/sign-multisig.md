description: How to sign a Multisig transaction from the command line
---

The Flow CLI provides a command to sign a multsi transaction with options to specify
signer account.

Use this functionality after a multisig transaction has been generated:
 - When a multisig transaction the keys needed to sign have already been identified
 - This signing method will first pull down the transaction RLP from url to allow the user to sign
 - After the transaction has been signed the resulting signed RLP will be posted to the server

```shell
flow multisig sign <transaction id ulr>
```

## Example Usage

```shell
> flow multisig sign https://path/to/tx/identifier --signer alice 

üôè RLP retrieved successfully
‚ú® Signed RLP Posted successfully

```

By not including `--yes` the transaction will be displayed so the user can verify what is being signed
